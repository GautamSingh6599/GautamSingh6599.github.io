    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m Gautam Singh, a 3rd senior at the Indian Institute of Science
      Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata, pursuing a 5-year BS-MS dual
      degree program with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer
      Science.
      <br />
      My academic journey, combined with a strong passion for computational
      techniques, has allowed me to delve into a wide array of topics, from real
      analysis to graph algorithms. Here, I share my thoughts, notes, and
      insights on the subjects that fascinate me, with a focus on mathematics,
      machine learning, and algorithm design. I enjoy building and exploring
      solutions that lie at the intersection of theory and application. <br />
      I also led the SlashDot programming club, fostering a community of over
      600+ science and mathematics enthusiasts, organizing workshops, coding
      sessions, and contests. Feel free to explore my posts, connect with me on
      social platforms, or reach out for collaboration!
      <br />

      PS: If you want to contact me, please mail me. I read my mail everyday and
      if you send me a message on social media, I might miss it. <br />
