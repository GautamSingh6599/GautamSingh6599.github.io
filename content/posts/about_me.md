## About Me

Hi, I'm Gautam Singh, a 3rd senior at the Indian Institute of Science Education
and Research (IISER) Kolkata, pursuing a 5-year BS-MS dual degree program with
and majoring in Mathematics. (I am also pursuing a minor in CS.)

I enjoy building and exploring solutions that lie at the intersection of theory
and application, and I'm particularly interested in theoretical computer science
and statistical learning theory.

I also led the SlashDot programming club, fostering a community of over 600+
science and mathematics enthusiasts, organizing workshops, coding sessions,
and contests.

PS: If you want to contact me, please mail me. I read my mail everyday and
if you send me a message on social media, I might miss it.
